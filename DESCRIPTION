Description: multiHiCcompare provides functions for joint normalization 
    and difference detection in multiple Hi-C datasets. This extension of
    the original HiCcompare package now allows for Hi-C experiments with 
    more than 2 groups and multiple samples per group. multiHiCcompare 
    operates on processed Hi-C data in the form of sparse upper triangular 
    matrices. It accepts four column (chromosome, region1, region2, IF)
    tab-separated text files storing chromatin interaction matrices. 
    multiHiCcompare provides cyclic loess and fast loess (fastlo) methods
    adapted to jointly normalizing Hi-C data. Additionally, it provides 
    a general linear model (GLM) framework adapting the edgeR package to detect
    differences in Hi-C data in a distance dependent manner.
